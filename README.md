**Zeitgeist Borders enable you to map suggestions from all Google search domains over a world map.**

By passing your mouse over a country you get the list of all related suggestions:

By passing your mouse over a suggestion you see all the related countries being highlighted on the map:

Add a space after the last word of your query if you don't want Zeitgeist Borders to suggests you completion of the single last word instead of completion of your whole query.
